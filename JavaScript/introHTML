3. How HTML Works?
-When you open a website:

-It understands the tags and displays text, images, and links accordingly.
(If CSS or JavaScript is included, it applies styling and adds functionality)
------------------------
<!DOCTYPE html>:-It tells the browser, "This is an HTML5 page. Use the modern rules to display it.
<html>:-
-This is the root tag. It wraps everything on the page.
-All other tags go inside this tag.
-If the <html> tag is missing, the browser will still try to guess—but this is a bad practice.
<head>:This tag contains information about the page.
It can include:
-<title/>, <meta/>, Links to fonts, CSS stylesheets, favicon, etc.
<title>:
-The text inside this tag appears on the browser tab.
-It helps users know what page they are on.
<body/>:-This tag contains everything you want users to see on the page.
