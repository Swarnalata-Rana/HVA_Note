1.What is Object?
-Object is a container which is hold different kinds of item.
-Like- strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, or even functions.
-Object difine with a {} inside the {key:value}, This is called a key-value pair.
-In object when a variable stores a function, we call it a method.
-If it stores any other kind of value, we call it a property.
-By use square brackets [] to access or change properties. 

2.Dot Notation.
- Using the dot . operator, you can reach inside the container and access its properties and methods.
*Once you create an object,You can do this things:
-Access existing values
-Change those values
-Add new properties or methods
-Call methods
Tips:
-The dot operator is used to access the properties or methods inside an object.
-When you see a dot in JavaScript, it usually means you are working with an object.
- The variable before the dot is the object, and the part after the dot is either a property or a method.

3.Objects using new Object()
-new Object() always returns an empty object
-You must add each property manually

4.Objects Using Classes.
-A class is like a blueprint or template. 
-It defines what kind of properties and methods an object should have.
-Once we have a class, we can use it to create many objects of the same type without repeating the structure.

5.How to difice a class?
-We use the class keyword to define a class. 
-Inside the class, we write a special function called constructor() to set up the properties.

*Code explain:-

class Student {
  constructor(name, age) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
  }

  greet() {
    console.log("Hello, welcome!");
  }
}
let student1 = new Student("Rahul", 20);

-The new keyword is what creates a brand new empty object.
-Then, it calls the constructor(name, age) method of the class.
-The values "Rahul" and 20 are passed into the constructor.
*So inside the constructor:
-name holds "Rahul"
-age holds 20
-The this refers to the new object being created. It helps us add properties to that new object.

*Code:this.name = name;
-This creates a new property name inside the new object and stores the value "Rahul" in it.

6.Why we use class?
-Just imagine a scenario where we need to create objects with many properties and methods. 
-Writing them again and again would be difficult and error-prone.
*Benifits of using class:-
-With a class, we define the structure once. 
-Then, every time we create a new object using that class. 
-All the properties and methods are automatically included. 
-We just write one line and get a complete object.

7.What is this keyword.
-this is a keyword that refers to the current object.
-either the one being created or the one calling the method.

8.Using for-in Loop in Object.
- for-in loop use to go through all the properties one by one.

9.Bracket Notation.
-We use bracket notation here because key is a variable. 
-Dot notation (student.key) would look for a property actually named "key", which does not exis.

10.Method Chaining.
*Code:let r = a.b().c().d();
-a is an object
-b is a method inside an object a.
-c is a method inside the object returned by b
-d is a method inside the object returned by c
(each method returned an object).
-Method chaining works only when each method returns an object.

11.What is Nested Objects?
-In Javascrit a object not only hold numbers, or string  but also other objects.
-Objec inside a object are called nested objects.

Code:
let student = {
  name: "Rahul",
  age: 20,
  address: {
    street: "MG Road",
    city: "Mumbai"
  }
};
console.log(student.address.street);
-This is called deep property access. Each dot moves one level deeper inside the structure.

12.Object References.
-In JavaScript, objects are stored by reference, not by value.
-This means that when we assign one object to another variable, we are not making a new copy of the object. 
-We are just assigning a new name to the same object.

Code:

let student1 = {
  name: "Rahul",
  age: 20
};
let student2 = student1;
student2.age = 21;
console.log(student1.age);#21 is output

13.New lear about how works key?
-One key variable can work for many objects only if they share the same keys.
Code:
let obj1 = { a: 10, b: 20 };
let obj2 = { a: 100, b: 200 };
for (let key in obj) {
  console.log("obj1:", obj1[key]);o/p-obj1: 10,obj2: 100
  console.log("obj2:", obj2[key]);o/p-obj:20,obj:200

}
-If keys are different → undefined is returned for missing keys.
Code:
let obj = { a: 1, b: 2 };
let obj1 = { d: 10, e: 20 };
for (let key in obj) {
  console.log("obj:", obj[key]); o/p-obj:1, obj1:2
  console.log("obj1:", obj1[key]); o/p-undefined, obj:undefined
}
