1.What is a String?
-String is a type of data in javascript.
-And its trore to text.like letters, string, spaces and symbol.
-String are written insite the quoteslike- " ", ' ', and ` `.
-You must open and close with the same type of quote.

2.Why do we use strings?
-To show messages to the user.
-To store names, places, or sentences.
-To work with letters, words, or any written data.

3.What is concatenation in string.
-When we join or combine two or more string by using +operater. that is called concatenation.
-Use + to combine two or more strings.
-Add spaces manually where needed.
-Works with variables and other values.

4.What is template literals?Why use?
-We already saw backticks ` ` used to create strings.
-To easily insert variables or expressions inside strings.
-To write multi-line strings.
-(You can insert variables, expressions, or even function calls inside ${}.
-Useful for cleaner, multi-line, and dynamic strings.)

5.Looping Through a String?
-Sometimes we want to look at each character in a string, one by one. We can do this using loops.

*This is helpful when we want to:
-Check or count each letter.
-Find a specific character.
-Change characters.
-Combine characters in a new way.

-Use for or while loops to go through a string.
-Use string[i] to get each character.
-Loop until i < string.length.
-You can read, check, and combine characters inside the loop.

6.String properties.
-.length is the main property of a string.
-It gives the total number of characters.
-It is read-only and cannot be changed.

7.Common String Methods.
-In JavaScript, a method is a built-in function you can use on a string.
*String methods help us:
-Change the text
-Search inside a string
-Cut or clean a string

*Methods:-
1-toUpperCase() – Make all letters big
let word = "hello";
console.log(word.toUpperCase());

2-toLowerCase() – Make all letters small
let name = "ALI";
console.log(name.toLowerCase());

3-trim() – Remove spaces from start and end
let text = "  hello  ";
console.log(text.trim()); 

4-includes() – Check if one string is inside another if yes returm true else false.
let sentence = "I like apples";
console.log(sentence.includes("apple"));

5-indexOf() – Find the position of a letter or word
-Returns the index (number position) of the first match found. If not found, it returns -1.
let str = "banana";
console.log(str.indexOf("n"));

6-slice() – Cut part of the string
-Takes out a piece of the string from one index to another (end is not included).
let word = "Elephant";
console.log(word.slice(0, 3)); 

7-replace() – Change part of a string   
-Replaces the first match of a word with something else. Useful for editing messages.
let msg = "I like tea";
console.log(msg.replace("tea", "coffee")); 

*summery
-String methods help you change or check text.
-Always use `()` after the method name.
-They return a new string. (they do not change the original string)


8.What does immutable mean?
-In JavaScript, strings are immutable. That means you can't chenge the original string after it is create.
-You cannot change a character inside a string.
-You cannot add characters to the original string.
-You can make a new string, but not change the old one.
-Always create a new string if you need to change it.
