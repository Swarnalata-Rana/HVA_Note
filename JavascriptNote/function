1.What is function?
-A function is a named block of code.
-When we called that function name then its run.
2.Why?
-To avoid repeating code(reuseble).
-To make code easier to read and maintain.

3.Every function in JavaScript has two main parts:-
-Defining a function — describing what the function does.
Code:
function greet() {
    console.log("Hello!");
}
-Calling a function — asking the function to run.
Code:greet(); // Output: Hello!

4.Return Ends the Function
-Once JavaScript reaches a return statement, it immediately exits the function. 
-Any code written after return inside the function will not run.

5.Parameters vs Arguments.
-When we define a function, we use parameter. (Like variables)
-When we call the function, we provide arguments. (Like values)

6.Variable Scope in Functions.
-Scope is 2 types one is local and another is global.
-Variables defined inside a function have local scope and cannot be used outside.
-But variables defined outside a function have global scope and can be used inside (if needed).

7.Anonymous Functions.
-An anonymous function is a function without a name. For example:
-We store it inside a variable.
-Then we can call the function using that variable name.

Code:
let getGreeting = function() {
    return "Hi there!";
};

// Now we can call the function using the variable name
console.log(getGreeting());// Output: Hi there!

-We created a function with no name.
-We stored it inside a variable named getGreeting.
-We then called the function using the variable name.

8.Arrow Functions.
-Arrow functions are a shorter and cleaner way to write in JavaScript.
-In an arrow function, we remove the function keyword. 
-And instead of that keyword we use the => arrow.

Code:-
let getGreeting = () => {
    return "Hi there!";
};

9.Callback Functions and Higher Order Functions.
-The callback function is independent. It has its own job to do.
-The higher-order function depends on the callback to finish its work.

function fun1(){
    console.log("Hello Runu")
}
function fun2(){
    console.log("I Love You!")
}
fun2(fun1())

-fun2() high order function.
-fun1() callback funcation.

-A function whice is takes another function as a argument, that is called high order function.
-(A callback function is a helper function that’s passed into another function.)
-A function which is pass into a another function that is called callback function.
