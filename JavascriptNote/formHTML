1.What is Form?
-A form is a part of a website where users can type in or select information like their name, email, or a message. 
-It’s like a digital version of a paper form you fill out at a bank or doctor’s office.

2.The action Attribute work?
-The action attribute tells the browser where to send the form data. 
-After the user clicks the submit button. 

-<form action="/submit-form"></form>:The action and method attributes control how and where the data is sent.

-<form action="#"></form>: By use # This will stop the form from doing anything when submitted.

GET: Sends the data through the URL. 
-This is useful for search forms. 
-It is not secure, so don’t use it for passwords.

POST: Sends the data in the background. 
-This is more secure and better for sign-up or login forms.
