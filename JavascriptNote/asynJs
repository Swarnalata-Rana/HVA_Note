-Understanding Asynchronous JavaScript and the Event Loop
-Js is a synchonus and single-threaded language.

*Synchonus:-(bloking)
--code run line by line
--one line is compete then its go to the another line.

*Asynchonus:-(non-bloking)
--Asynchronous programming, it can start a task and move on. (without waiting aynithing.)
--Then come back later when the task is done without freezing the whole program.

*single-threaded:-
--JavaScript is single-threaded — it can only do one thing at a time.

*Event Loop:-
--The Event Loop helps JavaScript look multitasking, 
--even though it runs on a single thread.
--It ensures that synchronous code runs first, 
--and asynchronous callbacks run later when the stack is clear. 

*What is Callbacks?
-A callback function is that you pass into another function to be called later, that is called callback function.
-A callback is a function passed into another function.
-JavaScript uses callbacks heavily for asynchronous tasks.
-Event listeners and timers use callbacks.
-Callbacks let JavaScript say: “Do this later.”
-Too many nested callbacks can lead to messy code — known as callback hell.
-Promises and async/await help make this cleaner (coming soon!).

*What is promise in Js?Why it use?
-Promise is a type of object in javaScript. 
-It represent a task that will finish in future successfully or with an Error.
-It used because stop the callback hell.(callbacks insite the callbacks)

*3 state in promise
-Resolve, reject and panding

*2 build-in method
-then(callback) → you call this and pass a callback. The callback runs if the Promise is resolved.
- catch(callback) → you call this and pass a callback. The callback runs if the Promise is rejected.
You can use both like this:


*Async/Await:-
-Async makes a function and return a promise and
-Await makes an async function and wait for a promise.

-When we add async before a function, it means the function will always return a Promise.
-By the using 2 keyword we can write Ascynchronus code in a synchronus maneer.



----------------
-JavaScript can run only one piece of work at a time.
-Blocking happens when JavaScript is busy for a long time, so it cannot move to the next line of code.
-Blocking happens when JavaScript is busy for a long time, so it cannot move to the next line of code.
-JavaScript gives any waiting tasks to the helper and continues useful work.
-A task is one full piece of work that JavaScript runs from start to end.
