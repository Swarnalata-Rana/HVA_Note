1.What is array in Js?
-Array is a list of values. Whice is stored together in one place.
-In JavaScript, an array lets you save multiple values using a single variable.
-The value should be numbers, string, booloes and other array.

*Updating and adding array:
-You can change any value in an array by using its index.
-You can also add a new value to the array by giving a value to a new index:

2.Using a For-Of Loop (Important)
JavaScript has a special loop made just for arrays. It is called the for-of loop.
This loop does not need any index. It runs automatically for each item in the array.

*Which One to Use?
Use for in loop:
-When you need the index (position number)
Use for-of loop:
-When you just need the values

*Property: length
The most commonly used property of an array is length. It tells us how many items are in the array.

*Method: push()
The push() method adds a new item at last in the array.

*Method: pop()
The pop() method removes the last item from the array.

*Array Methods: foreach(), map(), filter()

1.forEach()-When we want to do something in each item in that array. At that time we use forEach() method.
-Its work like a loop.and access all the item inside the array.

Code:-
let fruits = ["apple", "banana", "mango"];

fruits.forEach(function(fruit) {
  console.log(fruit);
});

-forEach() — this is the higher order function, we are calling it using ().
-function(fruit) { ... } — this nameless function is the callback function.
-We are only defining it and passing it to forEach(). We do not call it. 
-forEach() will internally call it for each item in the array.
-forEach() will call the callback function once for each item in the array. 
-If there are 3 items in the array, forEach() will call it 3 times once with each item.

2.map()-The map() method is used to transform each item in an array.
-(It's do the same operation with each item in that aaray.)
-And return a new array of the same length.
-Each time, the callback function receives one element from the array.
-Applies some change to it, and returns the new value.

Code:-
let prices = [100, 200, 300];
let newPrices = prices.map(function(price) {
  return price + 50;
});
console.log(newPrices);

-Map() also a high order function. 
-Map will call internally each item in the array.

3.filter()
-The filter() method is used to remove items baced on the condition and return a smaller array.

Code:-

let numbers = [10, 25, 30, 15];
#result is a callnack function 
let result=function(num) {
  return num > 20;
}
#bigNumber is a high order fuction
let bigNumbers =numbers.filter(result)
console.log(bigNumbers)

3.What is Rest and Spread Operators?
-In JavaScript, the same symbol ... is used for two different but related features:
-Even though they look the same, they do opposite things. Let’s understand them one by one.

*Rest Operator...
-The rest operator is used to collect multiple values into a single array.
-It is mostly used in function parameters to collect extra arguments passed to the function

Code:-
function printNames(...names) {
  console.log(names);
}

printNames("Ali", "Sara", "Ravi");
O/P-["Ali", "Sara", "Ravi"]

*Spread Operator ...
-The spread operator is used to spread out the elements of an array. 
-It takes a group of values (like an array) and expands them into individual values.
*It is mainly used in three ways:
-Sending array elements as separate arguments to a function
-Copying an array
-Merging arrays
*summery:-
-The same ... behaves differently based on where it is used:
-In function parameters → it’s a rest operator.
-In function calls or array brackets → it’s a spread operator.
-Think of rest as gathering things into a box, and spread as taking things out of a box.
